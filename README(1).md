A django Church Portal 



## Getting Started
The mission is simple. We are building a solution to automate the church's flagship data submission and reporting processes.

Without automation, these processes in themselves have contributed to the high growth and expansion of the church all over the world.

What we are doing here today is not just another cool UD thing, it is going to impact greatly the growth of the church and the work of the ministry to carry the gospel to the ends of the world.

In the words of Bishop Kakra, "things don't just happen by osmosis." The furtherance of the Kingdom takes a lot, especially the skills, time, and resource inputs of the faithful.
